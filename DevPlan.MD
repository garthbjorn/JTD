## Summary
JTD is a Tower Defense game that I am making to practice working with C# and the Unity game engine.
It has online multiplayer, infinite rounds, scaling enemies, and customizable towers.
## Plan
1. Get a lobby system up and running
    - Initially lobby system will be direct IP connection (requiring port fowarding)
    - Hopefully in the future it will leverage Steamworks to allow Steam friends list invites
2. Create main menu and hook up lobby system
    - Play
      - Solo
      - Multiplayer (2-? players)
    - Settings
      - Audio
      - ??
    - Quit
    - ??
3. Single tower placement from UI
   - Tower ownership
   - Tower damage
   - Tower ability to fire
4. Enemies movement
   - Enemy goal
   - Enemy health
   - Enemy damage to player
5. Scoring
    - Enemy scoring (health loss)
    - Player scoring (ememy kill)
